This directory contains scripts used to generate graph structures for our graph prior. To generate graphs, you will need some environemnt with `graph-tool` [installed](https://graph-tool.skewed.de/installation.html) (unfortunetely, it can not be installed via `uv`). When installed, you can run `bin/prior/generator.py` with configs from `bin/prior/configs` to generate graphs and `bin/prior/prepare_info.py` to create `info.yaml` file that will contain some meta-information about generated graphs.
